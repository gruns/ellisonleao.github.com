**_This post took longer than i thought to be done, but it’s better later than never, right?_**

February 2014 was a great month for me. I could build something that i think helped a lot of people to start making games. This 2 day project, called [Clumsy Bird](http://github.com/ellisonleao/clumsy-bird/), a simple clone of the famous Flappy Bird, just because it was (and still is) an open source project, got a lot of visibility from all over the world. One of the things that gave him so much stars on github (400 stars in just 1 week) , was the [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7206155) post, with a lot of positive comments and a lot of haters as usual too.#### How it was done

The game was made with a fabulous game framework called [MelonJS](http://melonjs.org), which i recommend to all game developers that needs to make high quality games and fast.

My prior motivation to make this project was to show to game developers aspirants that they didn’t need to spent hundreds of dollars buying pre-made game clones. My cost to make this game was **ZERO** ( despite the energy cost, obviously ) and i’ve only used free tools:

*   [VIM](http://www.vim.org/) for text editing
*   [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) for sounds effects and music
*   Google Images
*   Google Fonts#### Some statistics

The game has already 137 forks with more than 10 *clumsy bird clones* made. [Even a 404 page was made with a fork](http://campanja.com/404/)

*   The [official game website](http://ellisonleao.github.io/clumsy-bird/) is having an average of 3k access per day and more than 180k views already.
*   We had 6 contributors on the official repo that helped fix a lot of issues and some bugs.#### Some press mentions
